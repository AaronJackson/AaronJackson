### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Aaron

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AaronJackson/AaronJackson/master/asj.png" />

I am a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. 
I am a member of the [Computer Vision Laboratory](http://cvl.cs.nott.ac.uk) and my research falls mainly into the categories of 3D reconstruction and image based plant phenotyping. 
Outside of work, I spend the majority of my time drinking absurd amounts of tea, listening to music, cycling around Nottingham, tinkering with electronics, fiddling with radios (M6PIU) and trying to repair old computers.
If you're feeling brave you can see what I'm up to by taking a look at my [blog](https://aaronsplace.co.uk/blog).
