There's a lot of mess in here... Let me try to give you some guidance.

- ü§° Code for "Large Pose 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image via Direct Volumetric Regression" [vrn](https://github.com/AaronJackson/vrn), which is also available on Docker Hub as a container image [vrn-docker](https://github.com/AaronJackson/vrn-docker)
- üìª Hacky scripts for ax25d on Linux [ax25hacks](https://github.com/AaronJackson/ax25hacks)
- üåç Poorly written web server for your PDP-11 [2.11BSDhttpd](https://github.com/AaronJackson/2.11BSDhttpd)
- üêç A Lisp interpreter written in K&R C for your PDP-11 [bnlisp](https://github.com/AaronJackson/bnlisp)
- üòà Some attempts at drivers in my 2.11BSD [fork](https://github.com/AaronJackson/2.11BSD), including a dummy driver for learning, and a driver for the IBV11 GPIB controller. See branches!
