### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Aaron

There's a lot of mess in here... Let me try to give you some guidance.

- Code for "Large Pose 3D Face Reconstruction from a Single Image via Direct Volumetric Regression" [vrn](https://github.com/AaronJackson/vrn), which is also available on Docker Hub as a container image [vrn-docker](https://github.com/AaronJackson/vrn-docker)
- A poorly written web server for your PDP-11 [2.11BSDhttpd](https://github.com/AaronJackson/2.11BSDhttpd)
- A lisp written in K&R C for your PDP-11 [bnlisp](https://github.com/AaronJackson/bnlisp)

Ah, actually... when you skim the crud off the top, there isn't actually much here.
